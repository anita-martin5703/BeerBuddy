# Beer Buddy!

### Brief Overview

This app will be appealing to anyone who loves beer! (of course 21+) It will help you locate
breweries around your area, by mapping it out right on your mobile device. (using Google Maps) 
When you click on the different breweries you will be able display top beers they carry, 
the hours they are open, any specials/event that are happening that day and of course a link to their
homepage. The app will be capable of a search-by-beer options as well, to narrow down where you can
purchase the specific beer. This can be at a local store, a brewery, or a bar. Another option is 
you will have access to the newest spots that are opening up. Lastly you will also see the Top 
Breweries that are in the area. Persist data I would like to keep the userâ€™s favorite beer places and 
previous drink searches.
