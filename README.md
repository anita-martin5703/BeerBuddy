# Beer Buddy!

### Brief Overview

This app will be appealing to anyone who loves beer! It will help you locate
brewery’s around your area, by mapping it out right on your mobile device. When you click on 
the different brewery you will be able display top beers they carry, the hours they are
open, any specials/event that are happening that day and of course a link to their
homepage. The app will be capable of a search-by-beer options as well, to narrow down where you can
purchase beer. This can be at a local store, a brewery, or a bar. Another option is you will have
access to the newest spots that are opening up. Lastly you will also see the Top Brewery that are
in the area. Persist data I would like to keep the user’s favorite beer places and 
previous drink searches.
