## Description of Current Sate of App
The app Beer Buddy is not complete and still has a lot of work left to do on it. 69 Warnings
and 1 weak warning are present at the moment (According to the Code Inspection that I ran).
When you first open the app it will bring you to a log-in screen and once you get pass that
you should be able to see the first fragment which it the Bar Fragment. You can fill in the 
information but it does nothing yet, the list view does not display anything yet either.  
 
* Hit List to work on:
    1. Get rid of the Errors and as much warnings as possible.
    2. Incorporate the API (Untappd) that I have to fill my database.
    3. Get buttons to work properly in all the Fragments(updating, clearing, add buttons)
    4. Bugs/errors that pop up are the following in this [list](List-of-Errors.md).

## Aesthetic and Cosmetic
Beer Buddy is not functioning at the moment like its suppose to. 
Here is the list of things I would like to accomplish for it to work properly:
1. Get the API connection to import the database.
2. Get buttons to work so you can filter by inputted information.

## Stretch Goals
1. Add in Google Maps and place makers at all the Bars.
2. Add in self-made icons and spruce it up to make it more presentable.
3. Add in a personal logo.
