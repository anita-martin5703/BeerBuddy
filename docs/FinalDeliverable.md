## Description of Current Sate of App
<p>The app Beer Buddy is not complete and still has a lot of work left to do on it. 38  Android Warnings
are present at the moment (According to the Code Inspection that I ran).
When you first open the app it will bring you to the Google Sign-in screen and once you get pass that
you should be able to see the Bar fragment which will be holding data in the List View. In the top right 
corner you can pull down the Navigational Drawer and it has four selections. Bar, Beer, and Sign-Out work but Happy
hour does not it will crash. In both the Beer and Bar windows it will display only information and the 
buttons on the bottom do not work yet. You can fill in the the Edit Text information but it does nothing yet. Sign-out will
work and take you back to the beginning of when you first launched the app.</p>
 
* Hit List to work on:
    1. Get rid of the Errors and as much warnings as possible.
    2. In Happy Hour get the whole fragment to work, from adding and displaying information.
    3. Get buttons to work properly in all the Fragments(updating, clearing, add buttons)
    4. Bugs/errors that pop up are the following in this [list](List-of-Errors.md).

## Aesthetic and Cosmetic
Beer Buddy is not functioning 100% like I would like it too. However you can still navigate around from window to window.  
Here is the list of things I would like to accomplish for it to work properly:
1. Get the API connection to import the database.
2. Get buttons to work so you can filter by inputted information.

## Stretch Goals
1. Add in Google Maps and place makers at all the Bars.
2. Add in self-made icons and spruce it up to make it more presentable.
3. Add in a personal logo.
4. Find a better API to work with that has more information I can display.
