## Summary
As week sixth is upon us where I am at on my Android is not where I would like to be,
however I have narrowed down my classes from 5 to 3, thanks to Chris. I have also been
able to verify that my database is showing some information using Chrome. I also have
laid out my layouts that I wanted them to look. Its pretty simple and when/if I get more
time I would like to add some more things. There are three main fragments that I am 
working with, Map- will be my home, Beer List, and Happy Hour Listing. Right now I 
am focusing more on making sure my fragments are linking to one another and that my database
will keep working the way I want it too.  

## Walk Through
As you open up the App you will find yourself in the main Map page. That is not working
at the moment. Using the bottom navigation you can move through the different app windows.
When you click on the Beer button it will take you to a Listing of beers and you can description your preferences.
when you click on the Happy Hour button it takes you to a listing of Happy Hour Times and you
can also add in a time of one that you don't see.
