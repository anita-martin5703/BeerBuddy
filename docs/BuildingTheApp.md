# Beer Buddy Instruction for building the App

Steps in building the app:
1. Draw out the ERD with the database according to what you want to display to the user
    * Figure out the relationship of each class to each other (many-to-many, one-to-many)
    * Make sure to include Primary Keys and add in the type of data you will be displaying (String, int, etc.)
        ** Update as you move along in your app building
2. Draw out the base of the Wireframe on how to display the User Interface, be specific
    * Include annotations on what each items will do
3. Test your wireframes. Do this by displaying to your classmates, friends, family to get user input
    * May changes as necessary
4. Research and apply for API that will be incorporated in the app.
5. Start building the model in IntelliJ:
    * Layouts
    * Entities
    * Dao
    * Fragments
    * Database
    * ViewModels
6. Once you get you API Keys back start to build the POJO(if necessary) and Service classes
7. Using Postman start making calls to GET, POST, etc to your API and make changes in in your models if you have too
8. Once you figured out the correct call incorporate that into your Service Class
9. Use main activity to connect eveything together.
10. Test your app (should be doing this often through the entire build), make changes as necessary
11. Once everything comes together Create a Test Class and test it.
12. Start the documentation process:

    - Java Documentation

    - A list of the 3rd-party libraries used by your app.

    - A list of the external services consumed by your app.

    - Links to the wireframes and links to the up-to-date ERD and DDL for your appâ€™s data model.

    - A link to generated Javadoc HTML pages in your repository.

    - Links to all applicable licenses.

    - A link to instructions for building the app.

    - A link to basic instructions for using the app.
